# WPcatfacts
This is a node.js app that uses the Bandwidth catapult API to give you succint information about any topic over SMS.  It relies predominantly on Wikipedia, so basically it's a wikipedia interface for when you don't have 3G.

## What do?

Get API access and a number [here](http://ap.bandwidth.com/).  Catapault brokers between your app and the phones.  I've been running it locally, but it shouldn't be hard making it work on a PaaS.  The code is pretty bad, but this is a hackathon project so deal.

## cat fact?

* cat
* cat picture

* cat topics
* cat (topic)

You can get facts about things that aren't cats but then again why would you.
